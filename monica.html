        Stockholm, initially known as Monica Gaztambide, is a significant character
        in "Money Heist." Portrayed by Esther Acebo, Stockholm becomes an unexpected
        ally to the gang during the Royal Mint heist. Her character undergoes a
        transformation from a hostage to an active participant in the plan, reflecting
        themes of resilience and adaptation. The dynamics of Stockholm's relationships,
        particularly with Denver, add emotional depth to the series. As the story
        unfolds, Stockholm's journey becomes a compelling exploration of loyalty,
        sacrifice, and the blurred lines between captor and ally within the heist.
