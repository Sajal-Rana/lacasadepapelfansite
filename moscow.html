        Moscow, portrayed by Paco Tous, assumes the role of the Mint Supervisor
        in the Royal Mint of Spain heist in "Money Heist." With a background in
        minting currency, Moscow brings both expertise and a fatherly presence
        to the gang. His character is defined by a sense of responsibility, loyalty,
        and a desire to provide for his son Denver. Moscow's tragic journey unfolds
        amidst the complexities of the heist, showcasing the human side of the
        characters involved. As one of the emotional pillars of the series, Moscow's
        story explores themes of family, sacrifice, and the consequences of the
        criminal world.
