        Arturo, portrayed by Enrique Arce, is a polarizing character in "Money Heist."
        His presence in the Royal Mint of Spain heist adds a layer of tension and
        conflict to the narrative. Arturo's character is marked by selfishness,
        opportunism, and a desire for control, making him a troublesome figure
        within the group. Despite being a hostage, Arturo's actions create
        challenges for both the gang and fellow hostages. As the series progresses,
        Arturo's character becomes a symbol of the darker aspects of human nature
        amidst the intense circumstances of the heist, showcasing the complexities
        of morality and personal motivations in the world of Money Heist.
