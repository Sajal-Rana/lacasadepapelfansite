        Bogotá, portrayed by Hovik Keuchkerian, is a skilled counterfeiter in "Money Heist."
        His character brings a unique set of skills to the Royal Mint heist, making him
        an invaluable member of the gang. Bogotá's background and experiences add a layer
        of complexity to the story as he navigates the challenges of the high-stakes heist
        orchestrated by the Professor. Known for his wisdom and loyalty, Bogotá becomes an
        integral part of the dynamics within the group. As the series unfolds, Bogotá's
        character is central to themes of trust, camaraderie, and the pursuit of a common
        goal against formidable odds.
