        Colonel Luis Tamayo, portrayed by Fernando Cayo, is a strategic and influential
        character in "Money Heist." As the head of the Spanish National Police Corps,
        Tamayo becomes entangled in the events surrounding the Royal Mint heist and later
        the Bank of Spain heist orchestrated by the Professor. His character is marked by
        cunning intelligence and a strong desire to maintain control. Tamayo's interactions
        with the Professor and the gang add a political and strategic dimension to the story.
        As the series progresses, Tamayo's role becomes increasingly complex, delving into
        themes of power, ambition, and the consequences of crossing moral boundaries.
